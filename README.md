# Hollywood Stars Giphy API

[Live](https://yukanishijima.github.io/giphy-API/)

Click a button to display gifs of Hollywood stars, or create your own gif generating button to add a little fun to your boring day! 

## Site Functionality and Features

- Upon loading the page, Hollywood star name buttons will be shown by looping through an array of the names. 

- Once a user clicks on a button, the page will grab 5 static gifs from the GIPHY API and display them on the page.

- When the static gif is clicked, it starts playing. When the animated gif is clicked, it stops playing. 

- The page displays a rating and title of every gif, which is the data pulled from the Giphy API. 

- A user can enter his favourite Hollywood starâ€™s name in the form, which generates a new button on the page. 

- The game is fully responsive for mobile and laptop.
